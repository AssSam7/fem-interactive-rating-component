# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## Solution Approach

As this a straight forward component, I have chosen to stick without using any library/framework approach with pure CSS, and Javascript. Most of the CSS3 concepts have been applied for responsiveness with the desktop-first approach.
